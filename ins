a modifier that receives a reference to an std::ostream object. 

If there is a customer order on the back of the queue of orders waiting to be filled, this function moves it to the starting station on the line 

and then executes one step of the assembly process at all stations on the line. 

In the first part of that step, this function fills a customer order with one item at each station. 

The second part of the step moves the orders that are ready to be moved from each station. 

If a station has an order to move, the current object moves that order to the next station. 

If the order to be moved is at the last station, this function moves it to the back of either the completed orders queue or the incomplete orders queue. 

This function returns true if all the orders have been processed; false otherwise.
